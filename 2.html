        <h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Revenclaw</strong>is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School
          of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena
          Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit,
          learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and
          blue and bronze are its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius
          Flitwick and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, otherwise known as the
          daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, Helena Ravenclaw.

          Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air, and it is for
          that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze
          represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to
          do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires
