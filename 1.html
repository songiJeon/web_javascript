        <h2>Gryffindo</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Gryffindor</strong> is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts
          School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric
          Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students
          possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry,
          and determination[2], to be sorted into his house. The emblematic
          animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold.[1] Sir
          Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is
          the House ghost.

        <p>
          Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for
          this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent
          the house[1]. The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as
          well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold
          representing the coat.
