        <h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Hufflepuff</strong> is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts
          School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch
          Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four
          houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair
          play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic
          animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of
          Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron
          ghost.

          Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth,[5] and it is
          for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented
          wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.[6] The Hufflepuff point
          hourglass contains yellow diamonds.[7] Students sorted into Hufflepuff
          often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their
          correspondence to earth.
