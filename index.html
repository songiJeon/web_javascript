          Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the
          Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense
          popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They
          have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and
          are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2]

          worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and

          consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
          with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies in
          the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
